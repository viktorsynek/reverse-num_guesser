# Reversed Guess The Number in Python | Created by Viktor Synek
Reverse guess the number between 0-15

The user sets the number and the program tries to figure it out!

If the program guesses it in less than 3 tries, then it wins. If he cannot guess the number, the user wins!



Source code without comments, used functions, with loops so it is a play-over-over game, until you want it. Used 2 modules [random, time]
