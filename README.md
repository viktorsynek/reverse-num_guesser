# Reversed Guess The Number in Python | Created by Viktor Synek
Reverse guess the number between 0-15

The user sets the number and the program tries to figure it out!

If the program guesses the number in less than 3 tries, it wins. If it cannot guess the number, the user wins!

The game loops, so it can be played over and over, until we want to.
